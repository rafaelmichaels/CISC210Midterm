Story:
As a government agent we want to be able to detect chemical weapons and biological weapons so that we can keep society and communities safe.

Acceptance criteria:
When I turn the device on I want it to connect to a satellite link so that when we plug in coordinates where we know biological and chemical weapons are it will show us there are weapons there.

When I turn the device on I want it to connect to a satellite link so that when we plug in coordinates where we know there are no biological and chemical weapons it will show no weapons.

I want to be able to enter coordinates in to the device so that I can aim the satellite.

We have an idea of what to do with the sensors we are making.  Our acceptance criteria are testable because you can do them and they have a clear outcome.
